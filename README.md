## Project Overview
This application is a **campus marketplace platform** built for Clark University.  
It allows students to **buy and sell personal items** (books, electronics, furniture, etc.) within a secure community.  

Access is restricted to **Clark University students only**—logins are provided through student accounts to ensure trust and safety in the marketplace.

## Tech Used
1. **Angular** – Core front-end framework for building SPA.
2. **NgRx** – State management for predictable and scalable app behavior.
3. **PrimeFlex** – Utility-first CSS for responsive layouts.
4. **PrimeNG** – Rich UI component library for Angular.
5. **Docker** – Containerized application for consistent deployment.
6. **Jenkins** – Automated CI/CD pipeline integration.
